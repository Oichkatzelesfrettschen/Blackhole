# Background Assets

Store curated background images here. Use the manifest to capture licensing
and credit lines so the runtime can show proper attribution.

- `manifest.json` holds the asset list.
- `manifest.schema.json` documents required fields.
- Source/credit references live in `docs/IMAGE_SOURCES.md`.
